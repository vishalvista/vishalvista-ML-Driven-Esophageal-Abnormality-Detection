# vishalvista-ML-Driven-Esophageal-Abnormality-Detection
This project focuses on detecting esophageal abnormalities from gastrointestinal endoscopy video frames using deep learning techniques. It leverages CNN ConvLSTM, Faster R-CNN, and FS-CRF (Frame Search Conditional Random Field) to extract spatiotemporal features and classify abnormalities into normal, cancerous, and pre-cancerous stages.
